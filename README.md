This is my personal fork of [hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) with some changes that I need for my [blog](https://philipphagenlocher.de).

`install.sh` is provided to build and install _this_ specific version.

Changes:
* Render [KaTeX](https://katex.org) using [goldmark-katex](https://github.com/FurqanSoftware/goldmark-katex) (not configurable)
* Use a newer version of [chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma)
